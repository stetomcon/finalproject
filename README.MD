**The Concept** 

concept one:
FRESH TAILOR

creating an APP where people are able to go to a site and uplodad images that inspire their sense of style. Therefore anyone is able to go and post these items and you can browse the page not to just post but to look at others creations and get inspire by them. 

(Concept two: would be to create a pokedex using pokemons API)

**MVP**

MY MVP would be to create a fun layout with such a simple idead, be able to categorize them in certain ways to make it more user friendly.



**Tech being used**

- Ruby on Rails for the backend 
- Front end will be REACT or may changed depending on how it works 
- outside css framework (styled components)
